## [Settings](#settings){:name="settings"}
Within Codeship you are able to configure <%= docs_link_to "Deployment Pipelines", "/continuous-deployment/deployment-pipelines/" %>. You can easily add a Heroku Deployment choosing Heroku as deployment method.

You are asked to enter the **name of your Heroku application** and your **Heroku API key**. You need to create the application on Heroku first.

By clicking on **more options** you can configure additional settings.

### URL of your Heroku Application
After each deployment we check if your app is up. Therefore we call (```wget```) either the default ```*.herokuapp.com``` URL or the URL you specified here.

*Basic Auth* \\
If this URL requires basic auth please enter: ```http://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PASSWORD@YOUR_URL```

## [Run migration after the app is deployed](#migration){:name="migration"}
You can specify to run the migration during the Heroku deployment within the ***more options*** section. If you want to run your migration after the deployment, you can add a <%= docs_link_to "Script Deployment", "/continuous-deployment/deploying-with-your-own-script/" %> under the Heroku deployment and run the migration there.

~~~shell
heroku_run bundle exec rake db:migrate my_herokuapp_name
~~~
